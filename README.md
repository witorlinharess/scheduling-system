# Appointment Scheduling System for Beauty Clinics

This project is a simple and intuitive appointment scheduling system for beauty clinics. Developed with a focus on learning pure JavaScript, HTML, and Tailwind CSS, the system allows clients to schedule services quickly and easily, with a clean and modern interface.

## Features

Service Scheduling: A comprehensive form for clients to enter their information, choose a service, and select the date and time of the appointment.

Appointment Listing: Displays all upcoming appointments in an ordered list.

Technologies Used
HTML: For the page structure and markup.

JavaScript: Core system logic, including DOM manipulation and form events.

Tailwind CSS: A framework of utility classes for faster and more responsive design development.

## What I learned from this project

This project was essential for solidifying web development concepts, especially in:

DOM Manipulation: Managing user interaction and dynamically updating the interface.

Code Organization: Separating HTML and JavaScript into distinct files for better maintainability.

Responsive Design: Using Tailwind CSS to ensure the application is functional and visually pleasing on different screen sizes.

## Next Steps

The project will be enhanced by implementing a data persistence system, using Firebase Firestore to store appointments permanently, ensuring data is not lost when reloading the page.
